Here is the COVID-19 Dashboard I created through Tableau.
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ohad.shmueli/viz/Covid19ProjectDashboard_16871790828480/Dashboard1
In the Dashboard, I have created a Map that shows the Percent of the country's population which got infected by COVID-19.
The World's Total Deaths, Total Cases, and the World Death Percent.
The number of people who died in each Continent,
And the Top infected countries worldwide.
