This COVID-19 project aims to provide insights and shed light on the effects of the virus on different countries since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 and June 2023, including data for over 3 years which I got from the "Our World In Data" website. 
By examining various aspects such as the chances of dying if infected, the percentage of the country's population that got infected, and comparing deaths to the population, we are gaining a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact on different regions.
The addition of the new table with vaccination data adds another layer of analysis, allowing me to identify countries with higher vaccination rates, which is crucial in understanding the efforts made to protect the population against the virus.
By combining these analyses, I will be able to provide a more holistic view of the COVID-19 situation worldwide, highlighting patterns, trends, and differences among countries. This project can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the public, contributing to global understanding and response to the pandemic.
In the project, I used Excel and SQL to do some Data preparations – cleaning the data, removing missing values, removing duplicates, and using some commands for a clearer look and to convert some data into different data types.
Later, I imported the Data to Tableau to create an interactive Dashboard that displays the data in a simple and clean way to get insights. 
If I had more time to work on this project I would – 
1. Analyze the Vaccination Effectiveness: Analyze the effectiveness of vaccination by comparing the infection and mortality rates before and after vaccine distribution in different countries. 
2. Demographic Analysis: Investigate how COVID-19 affects different age groups, gender, or socioeconomic backgrounds within countries. That might identify the more vulnerable populations for public interventions. 
3. Policy and Intervention Assessment: Evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and interventions implemented by different countries to control the spread of COVID-19. Analyze the correlation between specific measures and changes in infection rates or deaths.
4. Predictive Modeling: Use predictive modeling and machine learning techniques to forecast future Covid-19 trends, including case counts, mortality rates, and vaccination rates. This can help in resource allocation and planning.
